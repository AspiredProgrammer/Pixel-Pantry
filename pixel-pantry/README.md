# Pixel Pantry

A Next.js recipe search application that helps you find recipes based on ingredients you have available.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, you'll need to:

1. **Get a Spoonacular API Key**: 
   - Go to [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Get your API key from your dashboard

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pixel-pantry
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
   - Add your Spoonacular API key:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
